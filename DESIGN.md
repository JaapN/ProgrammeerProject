Design Document
Based on your proposal, you can now start studying your problem in a more technical fashion. The teaching staff and your fellow students can help you spot if there are fundamental problems that need to be solved, or if there technical limitations that will likely prevent you from finishing the application.
An overview of your application
Map the separate parts of the solution onto the framework(s) that you are using. What APIs, methods or techniques do you need to implement each feature? Think about and fully express how the user interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various parts will work together to form a complete application.
It is expected that you separate in your code the user interface from the data management and from complex algorithms whenever possible.
Some parts that you may describe here:
•	a diagram of modules or classes that you’ve decided to implement, in appropriate detail
At least a map, barchart and graphs. The implementation of the graphs will be last, and which graphs will be implemented will depend on the map(s). If no interesting correlations can be found, then graphs between the better life index will be drawn.
•	advanced sketches of your UI that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying part of the code
The map, barcharts and graphs will be drawn when loading the page. When selecting a variable, the map will be displayed, and when clicking on a country on the respective map the barchart will be shown below the world map. This barchart will display the average graduate of every field, and the percentage of graduates in that field of that respective country.
Graphs can also be selected and will attempt to show the correlation between two variables.
•	a list of APIs and frameworks or plugins that you will be using to provide functionality in your app
•	a list of data sources if you will get data from an external source
http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx
•	a list of database tables and fields (and their types) if you will use a database
CSV exports to .json format. So I will use JSON-data.
If your application has multiple independent programs working together (e.g. a separate script to clean your dataset) you need to provide a high-level overview of these components and then provide a lower-level overview of the inner workings of each component.
Repository
Save your design document as DESIGN.md in the root of your GitHub repository. Don’t forget to update your README.md if you have made any incompatible decisions, and push that file, too!
